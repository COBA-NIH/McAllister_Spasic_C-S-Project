# Project outline

## The goals are to quantify:
1) The number of CD8+ cells
2) The % area of tissue that is SMA+
3) Distance association of CD8+ cells and SMA+ cells, i.e., measutrement of the average dustance of CD8+ cells from nearest SMA+ cell, and the number of CD8+ cells within a given distance (20, 50, and 100 um) of SMA+ cells

## Challenges
1) Variations in the staining intenisty of SMA
2) Accurate segmentation of fibrillar, non-circular objects
